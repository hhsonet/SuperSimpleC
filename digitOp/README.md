# Math Game: Two-Digit Operation Practice

A simple educational game for kids to practice arithmetic operations by splitting a two-digit number into its individual digits and applying a chosen operator.

## How It Works
1. The player enters a **two-digit number** (e.g., `56`).
2. The player selects a **mathematical operator** (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
3. The game splits the number into its **tens** and **units** digits.
4. The chosen operator is applied to the two digits.
5. The result is displayed as a formatted equation.

## Input/Output Format

### Input
- A valid two-digit number (e.g., `21`) and a single operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).


### Output
- A formatted string showing the calculation:
## Examples

| Input              | Output         |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Number: `56+`       | `5 + 6 = 11`   |
| Number: `21*`       | `2 * 1 = 2`    |
